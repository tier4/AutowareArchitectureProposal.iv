# MPC follower description

## Overview
A waypoint follower based on model predictive control (MPC) for accurate path tracking. This can be used as a waypoint_follower, as well as other path following nodes like pure_pursuit.


There are 2 nodes related to MPC follower.
 - `/mpc_waypoint_converter` : converts `/final_waypoints` to `/mpc_waypoints` which includes waypoints behind the self position. This is to solve temporary conflict of planning system and mpc follower so that mpc follower can be used in the same way as pure_pursuit. This will be removed in a future release.
 - `/mpc_follower` : generates control command (`/twist_raw` or/and `/ctrl_raw`) to follow `/mpc_waypoints`.

## Input and Output for mpc_follower
- input
    - /mpc_waypoints : reference waypoints (generated in mpc_waypoints_converter)
    - /current_pose : self pose
    - /vehicle_status : vehicle information (as velocity and steering angle source)
- output
    - /twist_raw : command for vehicle
    - /ctrl_raw : command for vehicle

## QP solver type

currently, the options are
- unconstraint : use least square method to solve unconstraint QP with eigen.
- unconstraint_fast : similar to unconstraint. This is faster, but lower accuracy for optimization.
- qpoases_hotstart : use QPOASES with hotstart for constraint QP.

## vehicle model type

- kinematics : bicycle kinematics model with steering 1st-order delay
- kinematics_no_delay : bicycle kinematics model without steering delay
- dynamics : bicycle dynamics model considering slip angle

The `kinematics` model are being used as default. Please see the reference[1] for more detail.

# how to tune MPC parameters

1. Set appropriate vehicle kinematics parameters `wheelbase`, `steering_gear_ratio`, and `steer_lim_deg`. Also check the `/vehicle_status` topic has appropriate values (speed: vehicle rear-wheels-center velocity [km/h], angle: steering (tire) angle [rad]). These values give a vehicle information to the controller for path following. Errors in these values cause fundamental tracking error. Whether these values are correct can be confirmed by comparing the angular velocity obtained from the model (`/mpc_follower/debug/angvel_from_steer`) and the actual angular velocity (such as `/estimate_twist/angular/z`).

2. Set appropriate vehicle dynamics parameters of `steering_tau`, which is approximated delay from steering angle command to actual steering angle.

3. Set `weight_steering_input` = 1.0, `weight_lat_error` = 0.1, and other weights to 0. If the vehicle oscillates when driving with low speed, set `weight_lat_error` smaller.

4. Adjust other weights. One of the simple way for tuning is to increase `weight_lat_error` until oscillation occurs. If the vehicle is unstable with very small `weight_lat_error`, increase terminal weight :  `weight_terminal_lat_error` and `weight_terminal_heading_error` to improve tracking stability.
 Larger `prediction_horizon` and smaller `prediction_sampling_time` is effective for tracking performance, but it is a trade-off between computational costs.
Other parameters can be adjusted like below.
 - `weight_lat_error`: Reduce lateral tracking error. This acts like P gain in PID.
 - `weight_heading_error`: Make a drive straight. This acts like D gain in PID.
 - `weight_heading_error_squared_vel_coeff` : Make a drive straight in high speed range.
 - `weight_steering_input`: Reduce oscillation of tracking.
 - `weight_steering_input_squared_vel_coeff`: Reduce oscillation of tracking in high speed range.
 - `weight_lat_jerk`: Reduce lateral jerk.
 - `weight_terminal_lat_error`: Preferable to set a higher value than normal lateral weight `weight_lat_error` for stability.
 - `weight_terminal_heading_error`: Preferable to set a higher value than normal heading weight `weight_heading_error` for stability.
