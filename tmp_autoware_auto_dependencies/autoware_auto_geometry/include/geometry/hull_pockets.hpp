/// \brief Compute a list of "pockets" of a simple polygon
///   (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_polygon), that is, the areas that make
///   up the difference between the polygon and its convex hull.
///   This currently has a bug:
//    * "Rollover" is not properly handled - if a pocket contains the segment from
//      the last point in the list to the first point (which is still part of the
//      polygon), that does not get added
///
/// \param[in] polygon_start Start iterator for the simple polygon (has to be on convex hull)
/// \param[in] polygon_end End iterator for the simple polygon
/// \param[in] convex_hull_start Start iterator for the convex hull of the simple polygon
/// \param[in] convex_hull_end End iterator for the convex hull of the simple polygon
/// \return A vector of vectors of the iterator value type. Each inner vector contains the points
///         for one pocket. We return by value instead of as iterator pairs, because it is possible
///         that the edge connecting the final point in the list and the first point in the list is
///         part of a pocket as well, and this is awkward to represent using iterators into the
///         original collection.
///
/// \tparam Iter1 Iterator to a point type
/// \tparam Iter2 Iterator to a point type (can be the same as Iter1, but does not need to be)
