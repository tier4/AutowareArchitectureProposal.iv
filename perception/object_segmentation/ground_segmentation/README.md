# ground_segmentation

## Purpose

The `ground_segmentation` is a node that filters the ground points from the input pointcloud.

## Inner-workings / Algorithms

### Ransac Ground Filter

This algorithm is SAC-based ground segmentation.

See: <https://pcl.readthedocs.io/projects/tutorials/en/latest/planar_segmentation.html>

### Ray Ground Filter

This algorithm is deprecated in current architecture.

### Scan Ground Filter

This algorithm works by following steps,

1. Divide whole pointclouds into groups by horizontal angle and sort by xy-distance.
2. Check the distance and vertical angle of the point one by one.
3. Set a center of the ground contact point of the rear or front wheels as the initial point.
4. Check vertical angle between the points. If the angle from the initial point is larger than "global_slope_max", the point is classified as "no ground".
5. If the angle from the previous point is larger than "local_max_slope", the point is classified as "no ground".
6. Otherwise the point is labeled as "ground point".
7. If the distance from the last checked point is close, ignore any vertical angle and set current point attribute to the same as the last point.
