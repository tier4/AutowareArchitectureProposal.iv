# pointcloud_preprocessor : occupancy_grid_map_outlier_filter

## Purpose

This node is an outlier filter based on a occupancy grid map.
Depending on the implementation of occupancy grid map, it can be called an outlier filter in time series, since the occupancy grid map expresses the occupancy probabilities in time series.

## Inner-workings / Algorithms

1. Use the occupancy grid map to separate point clouds into those with low occupancy probability and those with high occupancy probability.

2. The point clouds that belong to the low occupancy probability are not necessarily outliers. In particular, the top of the moving object tends to belong to the low occupancy probability. Therefore, if `use_radius_search_2d_filter` is true, then apply an radius search 2d outlier filter to the point cloud that is determined to have a low occupancy probability.
   1. For each low occupancy probability point, determine the outlier from the radius (`radius_search_2d_filter/search_radius`) and the number of point clouds. In this case, the point cloud to be referenced is not only low occupancy probability points, but all point cloud including high occupancy probability points.
   2. The number of point clouds can be multiplied by `radius_search_2d_filter/min_points_and_distance_ratio` and distance from base link. However, the minimum and maximum number of point clouds is limited.

The following video is a sample. Yellow points are high occupancy probability, green points are low occupancy probability which is not an outlier, and red points are outliers. At around 0:15 and 1:16 in the first video, a bird crosses the road, but it is considered as an outlier.

<!-- ## Assumptions / Known limits -->

<!-- Write assumptions and limitations of your implementation.

Example:
  This algorithm assumes obstacles are not moving, so if they rapidly move after the vehicle started to avoid them, it might collide with them.
  Also, this algorithm doesn't care about blind spots. In general, since too close obstacles aren't visible due to the sensing performance limit, please take enough margin to obstacles.
-->

<!-- ## (Optional) Error detection and handling -->

<!-- Write how to detect errors and how to recover from them.

Example:
  This package can handle up to 20 obstacles. If more obstacles found, this node will give up and raise diagnostic errors.
-->

<!-- ## (Optional) Performance characterization -->

<!-- Write performance information like complexity. If it wouldn't be the bottleneck, not necessary.

Example:
  ### Complexity

  This algorithm is O(N).

  ### Processing time

  ...
-->

## (Optional) References/External links

- [RadiusSearchOutlier](https://vml.sakura.ne.jp/koeda/PCL/tutorials/html/remove_outliers.html)

<!-- Write links you referred to when you implemented.

Example:
  [1] {link_to_a_thesis}
  [2] {link_to_an_issue}
-->

## (Optional) Future extensions / Unimplemented parts

<!-- Write future extensions of this package.

Example:
  Currently, this package can't handle the chattering obstacles well. We plan to add some probabilistic filters in the perception layer to improve it.
  Also, there are some parameters that should be global(e.g. vehicle size, max steering, etc.). These will be refactored and defined as global parameters so that we can share the same parameters between different nodes.
