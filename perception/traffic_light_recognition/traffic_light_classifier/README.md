### traffic_light_classifier
There's an implementation of CNN and HSV filter versions.

If you use CNN, the trained file are automatically downloaded when you build.

## Training
The model  used in this package was trained by [AutowareMLPlatform/classification_2d](https://github.com/tier4/AutowareMLPlatform/tree/master/tasks/classification_2d)

## model detail
**TODO1: attach AWS URL here for quick reference when, where and how the model was trained.**\
**TODO2: label file should be link to trained model.**

## label support
By default, this package only support typical type of traffic light in Japan. so only basic type of lamp is supported. please refer [LampState](https://github.com/tier4/autoware.iv/blob/master/common/msgs/autoware_perception_msgs/msg/traffic_light_recognition/LampState.msg)

label names are assumed to be comma-separated to represent each lamp.\
For example, the traffic light with red and right arrow lit are represented by label such as `"red,right"`, which are converted to the string array `["red", "right"]` in cnn_classifier, and finally array is converted to [LampState](https://github.com/tier4/autoware.iv/blob/master/common/msgs/autoware_perception_msgs/msg/traffic_light_recognition/LampState.msg) array.

## other country traffic light model
