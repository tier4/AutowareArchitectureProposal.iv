# lanelet2_extension package
This package contains external library for Lanelet2 and is meant to ease the use of Lanelet2 in Autoware.

## Lanelet Format for Autoware
Autoware uses extended Lanelet2 Format for Autoware, which means you need to add some tags to default OSM file if you want to fully use Lanelet2 maps. For details about custom tags, please refer to this [document](./docs/lanelet2_format_extension.md).

## Code API
### IO 
#### Autoware OSM Parser
Autoware Lanelet2 Format uses .osm extension as original Lanelet2.
However, there are some custom tags that is used by the parser.

Currently, this includes:
* overwriting x,y values with `local_x` and `local_y` tags.
* reading `<MapMetaInfo>` tag which contains information about map format version and map version.

The parser is registered as "autoware_osm_handler" as lanelet parser

### Projection
#### MGRS Projector
MGRS projector projects latitude longitude into MGRS Coordinates. 

### Regulatory Elements
#### Autoware Traffic Light
Autoware Traffic Light class allows you to retrieve information about traffic lights.
Autoware Traffic Light class contains following members:
* traffic light shape
* light bulbs information of traffic lights
* stopline associated to traffic light

### Utility
#### Message Conversion
This contains functions to convert lanelet map objects into ROS messages.
Currently it contains following conversions:
* lanelet::LaneletMapPtr to/from lanelet_msgs::MapBinMsg
* lanelet::Point3d to geometry_msgs::Point
* lanelet::Point2d to geometry_msgs::Point
* lanelet::BasicPoint3d to geometry_msgs::Point

#### Query
This module contains functions to retrieve various information from maps.
e.g. crosswalks, trafficlights, stoplines

#### Utilities
This module contains other useful functions related to Lanelet.
e.g. matching waypoint with lanelets

### Visualization
Visualization contains functions to convert lanelet objects into visualization marker messages.
Currently it contains following conversions:
* lanelet::Lanelet to Triangle Markers
* lanelet::LineString to LineStrip Markers
* TrafficLights to Triangle Markers

## Nodes
### lanelet2_extension_sample
Code for this explains how this lanelet2_extension library is used.
The executable is not meant to do anything.

### autoware_lanelet2_extension
This node checks if an .osm file follows the Autoware version of Lanelet2 format.
You can check by running:
```
rosrun lanelet2_extension autoware_lanelet2_validation _map_file:=<path/to/map.osm>
```
