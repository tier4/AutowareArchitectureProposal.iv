Interface for the OSQP library {#osqp_interface-package-design}
===========

This is the design document for the `osqp_interface` package.


# Purpose / Use cases
<!-- Required -->
<!-- Things to consider:
    - Why did we implement this feature? -->
This packages provides a C++ interface for the [OSQP library](https://osqp.org/docs/solver/index.html).


# Design
<!-- Required -->
<!-- Things to consider:
    - How does it work? -->
The class `OSQPInterface` takes a problem formulation as Eigen matrices and vectors, converts these objects into
C-style Compressed-Column-Sparse matrices and dynamic arrays, loads the data into the OSQP workspace dataholder, and runs the optimizer.

## Inputs / Outputs / API
<!-- Required -->
<!-- Things to consider:
    - How do you use the package / API? -->
 The interface can be used in several ways:

   1. Initialize the interface WITHOUT data. Load the problem formulation at the optimization call.
   ```
        osqp_interface = OSQPInterface();
        osqp_interface.optimize(P, A, q, l, u);
   ```

   2. Initialize the interface WITH data.
   ```
        osqp_interface = OSQPInterface(P, A, q, l, u);
        osqp_interface.optimize();
   ```

   3. WARM START OPTIMIZATION by modifying the problem formulation between optimization runs.
   ```
        osqp_interface = OSQPInterface(P, A, q, l, u);
        osqp_interface.optimize();
        osqp.initializeProblem(P_new, A_new, q_new, l_new, u_new);
        osqp_interface.optimize();
   ```

The optimization results are returned as a vector by the optimization function.
```
 std::tuple<std::vector<double>, std::vector<double>> result = osqp_interface.optimize();
 std::vector<double> param = std::get<0>(result);
 double x_0 = param[0];
 double x_1 = param[1];
```
