# dual_return_outlier_filter

## Purpose

The purpose is to remove point cloud noise such as fog and rain and publish visibility as a diagnostic topic.

## Inner-workings / Algorithms

This node can remove rain and fog by considering the light reflected from the object in two stages according to the attenuation factor. The `dual_return_outlier_filter` is named because it removes noise using data that contains two types of return values separated by attenuation factor, as shown in the figure below.

![outlier_filter-return_type](./image/outlier_filter-return_type.drawio.svg)

Therefore, in order to use this node, the sensor driver must publish custom data including `return_type`. please refer to [PointXYZIRADT](https://github.com/tier4/AutowareArchitectureProposal.iv/blob/5d8dff0db51634f0c42d2a3e87ca423fbee84348/sensing/preprocessor/pointcloud/pointcloud_preprocessor/include/pointcloud_preprocessor/outlier_filter/dual_return_outlier_filter_nodelet.hpp#L86-L96) data structure.

Another feature of this node is that it publishes visibility as a diagnostic topic. With this function, for example, in heavy rain, the sensing module can notify that the processing performance has reached its limit, which can lead to ensuring the safety of the vehicle.
