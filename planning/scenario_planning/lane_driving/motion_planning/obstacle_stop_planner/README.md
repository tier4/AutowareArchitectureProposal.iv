# Obstacle Stop Planner

## Overview

`obstacle_stop_planner` has following modules

- Obstacle Stop Planner
  - inserts a stop point in trajectory when there is a static point cloud on the trajectory.
- Slow Down Planner
  - inserts a deceleration section in trajectory when there is a point cloud near the trajectory.
- Adaptive Cruise Controller (ACC)
  - embeds target velocity in trajectory when there is a dynamic point cloud on the trajectory.

When the stop point that has 0 velocity is inserted, the point is inserted in front of the target point cloud by the distance of `baselink to front` + `stop margin`. The `baselink to front` means the distance between `base_link`(center of rear-wheel axis) and front of the car. `stop margin` is determined by the parameters described below.

![insert_stop_velocity](./docs/insert_velocity.drawio.svg)

When the deceleration section is inserted, the start point of the section is inserted in front of the target point cloud by the distance of `baselink to front` + `slow down forward margin`. the end point of the section is inserted behind the target point cloud by the distance of `slow down backward margin` + `baselink to rear`. The `baselink to rear` means the distance between `base_link` and rear of the car. The velocities of points in the deceleration section are modified to the deceleration velocity. `slow down backward margin` and `slow down forward margin` are determined by the parameters described below.

## Modules

### Obstacle Stop Planner

#### Role

`Obstacle Stop Planner` module inserts a stop point in trajectory when there is a static point cloud on the trajectory. This module does not work when `Adaptive Cruise Controller` works.

| Parameter                               | Type   | Description                                                                   |
| --------------------------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `stop_planner.stop_margin`              | double | stop margin distance from obstacle on the path [m]                            |
| `stop_planner.min_behavior_stop_margin` | double | stop margin distance when any other stop point is inserted in stop margin [m] |
| `stop_planner.step_length`              | double | step length for pointcloud search range [m]                                   |
| `stop_planner.extend_distance`          | double | extend trajectory to consider after goal obstacle in the extend_distance      |
| `stop_planner.expand_stop_range`        | double | margin of vehicle footprint [m]                                               |

#### Flowchart

```plantuml
@startuml
title insertStopPoint
start


:callback trajectory;

:trim trajectory from self-pose;

:decimate trajectory;

:generate detection area;

if ( search obstacle pointcloud in detection area?) then (yes(find))
else (no(not find))
  stop
endif

if ( insert target velocity by adaptive cruise module?) then (yes)
  stop
else (no)
endif

:insert stop point;


stop
@enduml
```

First, this module cut off the trajectory behind the car and decimates the points of trajectory for reducing computational costs.

Then, a detection area is generated by the decimated trajectory as following figure. The detection area means the area through which the vehicle-body passes.

![vehicle_shape](./docs/vehicle_shape.drawio.svg)

The module searches the obstacle pointcloud within detection area. When the pointcloud is found, `Adaptive Cruise Controller` modules starts to work. only when `Adaptive Cruise Controller` modules does not insert target velocity, the stop point is inserted to the trajectory. The stop point means the point with 0 velocity.

### Slow Down Planner

#### Role

`Slow Down Planner` module inserts a deceleration point in trajectory when there is a point cloud near the trajectory.

| Parameter                                     | Type   | Description                                                                                    |

| `slow_down_planner.min_slow_down_vel`         | double | min slow down velocity [m/s]                                                                   |

#### Flowchart

```plantuml
@startuml
title insertDecelerationPoint
start


:callback trajectory;

:trim trajectory from self-pose;

:decimate trajectory;

if ( search obstacle pointcloud in detection area?) then (yes(find))

@enduml
```

First, this module cut off the trajectory behind the car and decimates the points of trajectory for reducing computational costs. ( This is the same process as that of `Obstacle Stop planner` module. )

Then, a detection area is generated by the decimated trajectory as following figure. The detection area in this module is the extended area of the detection area used in `Obstacle Stop Planner` module. The distance to be extended depends on the above parameter `expand_slow_down_range`.

![vehicle_shape_decel](./docs/vehicle_shape_decel.drawio.svg)

The module searches the obstacle pointcloud within detection area. When the pointcloud is found, the deceleration point is inserted to the trajectory.

![pointcloud_decel](./docs/point_cloud_decel.drawio.svg)

The deceleration point means the point with low velocity; the value of the velocity $v_{target}$ is determined as follows.

$v_{target} = v_{min} + \frac{l_{ld} - l_{vw}/2}{l_{er}} (v_{max} - v_{min} )$

- $v_{min}$ is minimum target value of `Slow Down Planner` module. The value of $v_{min}$ depends on the parameter `min_slow_down_vel`.
- $v_{max}$ is maximum target value of `Slow Down Planner` module. The value of $v_{max}$ depends on the parameter `max_slow_down_vel`.
- $l_{ld}$ is the lateral deviation of the target pointcloud.
- $l_{vw}$ is the vehicle width.
- $l_{er}$ is the expand range of detection area. The value of $l_{er}$ depends on the parameter `expand_slow_down_range`

The above method means that the smaller the lateral deviation of the pointcloud, the lower the velocity of the deceleration point.

<!-- Moreover, to avoid sudden deceleration, If the current velocity of vehicle is higher than $v_{target}$, the deceleration is planned based on the current velocity. This indicates that there are cases where it is not possible to decelerate according to $v_{target}$ in such a situation that a point cloud in the detection area is suddenly appeared near the vehicle. -->

### Adaptive Cruise Controller

#### Role

`Adaptive Cruise Controller` module embeds maximum velocity in trajectory when there is a dynamic point cloud on the trajectory. The value of maximum velocity depends on the own velocity, the velocity of the point cloud ( = velocity of the front car), and the distance to the point cloud (= distance to the front car).

This module works only when the obstacle pointcloud is found in the detection area of the `Obstacle stop planner` module.
At first, the velocity of the pointcloud is estimated. The velocity estimation uses the velocity information of dynamic objects, or the distance to the point cloud found in the previous step.

Only when the estimation is succeeded and the estimated velocity exceeds the value of `obstacle_stop_velocity_thresh_*`, the distance to the pointcloud from self-position is calculated. For prevent chattering in the mode transition, `obstacle_velocity_thresh_to_start_acc` is used for the threshold to start adaptive cruise, and `obstacle_velocity_thresh_to_stop_acc` is used for the threshold to stop adaptive cruise. When the calculated distance value exceeds the emergency distance $d\_{emergency}$ calculated by emergency_stop parameters, target velocity to insert is calculated.

The emergency distance $d\_{emergency}$ is calculated as follows.

$d_{emergency} = d_{margin_{emergency}} + t_{idling_{emergency}} \cdot v_{ego} + (-\frac{v_{ego}^2}{2 \cdot  a_{ego_{emergency}}}) - (-\frac{v_{obj}^2}{2 \cdot a_{obj_{emergency}}})$

- $d_{margin_{emergency}}$ is a minimum margin to the obstacle pointcloud. The value of $d_{margin_{emergency}}$ depends on the parameter `min_dist_stop`
- $t_{idling_{emergency}}$ is a supposed idling time. The value of $t_{idling_{emergency}}$ depends on the parameter `emergency_stop_idling_time`
- $v_{ego}$ is a current velocity of own vehicle
- $a_{ego_{_{emergency}}}$ is a minimum acceleration (maximum deceleration) of own vehicle. The value of $a_{ego_{_{emergency}}}$ depends on the parameter `emergency_stop_acceleration`
- $v_{obj}$ is a current velocity of obstacle pointcloud.
- $a_{obj_{_{emergency}}}$ is a supposed minimum acceleration of obstacle pointcloud. The value of $a_{obj_{_{emergency}}}$ depends on the parameter `obstacle_emergency_stop_acceleration`
- \*Above $X_{_{emergency}}$ parameters are used only in emergency situation.

The target velocity is determined to keep the distance to the obstacle pointcloud from own vehicle at the standard distance $d\_{standard}$ calculated as following. Therefore, if the distance
to the obstacle pointcloud is longer than standard distance, The target velocity becomes higher than the current velocity, and vice versa. For keeping the distance, a PID controller is used.

$d_{standard} = d_{margin_{standard}} + t_{idling_{standard}} \cdot v_{ego} + (-\frac{v_{ego}^2}{2 \cdot  a_{ego_{standard}}}) - (-\frac{v_{obj}^2}{2 \cdot a_{obj_{standard}}})$

- $d_{margin_{standard}}$ is a minimum margin to the obstacle pointcloud. The value of $d_{margin_{standard}}$ depends on the parameter `min_dist_stop`
- $t_{idling_{standard}}$ is a supposed idling time. The value of $t_{idling_{standard}}$ depends on the parameter `standard_stop_idling_time`
- $v_{ego}$ is a current velocity of own vehicle
- $a_{ego_{_{standard}}}$ is a minimum acceleration (maximum deceleration) of own vehicle. The value of $a_{ego_{_{standard}}}$ depends on the parameter `min_standard_acceleration`
- $v_{obj}$ is a current velocity of obstacle pointcloud.
- $a_{obj_{_{standard}}}$ is a supposed minimum acceleration of obstacle pointcloud. The value of $a_{obj_{_{standard}}}$ depends on the parameter `obstacle_min_standard_acceleration`
- \*Above $X_{_{standard}}$ parameters are used only in non-emergency situation.

![adaptive_cruise](./docs/adaptive_cruise.drawio.svg)

If the target velocity exceeds the value of `thresh_vel_to_stop`, the target velocity is embedded in the trajectory.

## Known Limits

- It is strongly depends on velocity planning module whether or not it moves according to the target speed embedded by `Adaptive Cruise Controller` module. If the velocity planning module is updated, please take care of the vehicle's behavior as much as possible and always be ready for overriding.

- The velocity estimation algorithm in `Adaptive Cruise Controller` is depend on object tracking module. Please note that if the object-tracking fails or the tracking result is incorrect, it the possibility that the vehicle behaves dangerously.
