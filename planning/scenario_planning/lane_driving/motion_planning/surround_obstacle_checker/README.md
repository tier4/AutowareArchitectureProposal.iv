# Surround Obstacle Checker

## Purpose

`surround_obstacle_checker` is a module to prevent moving if any obstacles is near stopping ego vehicle.
This module runs only when ego vehicle is stopping.

### Algorithms

### Check data

Check that `surround_obstacle_checker` receives no ground pointcloud, dynamic objects and current velocity data.

### Get distance to nearest object

Calculate distance between ego vehicle and the nearest object.
In this function, it calculates the minimum distance between the polygon of ego vehicle and all points in pointclouds and the polygons of dynamic objects.

### Stop requirement

If it satisfies all following conditions, it plans stopping.

- Ego vehicle is stopped
- It satisfies any following conditions
  1. The distance to nearest obstacle satisfies following conditions
     - If state is `State::PASS`, the distance is less than `surround_check_distance`
     - If state is `State::STOP`, the distance is less than `surround_check_recover_distance`
  2. If it does not satisfies the condition in 1, elapsed time from the time it satisfies the condition in 1 is less than `state_clear_time`

### States

To prevent chattering, `surround_obstacle_checker` manages two states.
As mentioned in stop condition section, it prevents chattering by changing threshold to find surround obstacle depending on the states.

- `State::PASS` : Stop planning is released
- `State::STOP` ï¼šWhile stop planning

## Assumptions / Known limits

To perform stop planning, it is necessary to get obstacle pointclouds data.
Hence, it does not plan stopping if the obstacle is in blind spot.
