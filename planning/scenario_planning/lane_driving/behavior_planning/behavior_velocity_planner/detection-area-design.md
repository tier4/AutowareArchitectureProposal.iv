### Detection Area

#### Role

If pointcloud is detected in a detection area defined on a map, the stop planning will be executed at the predetermined point.

![brief](./docs/detection_area/detection_area.svg)

#### Launch Timing

Launches if there is a detection area on the target lane.

### Algorithm

1. Gets a detection area and stop line from map information and confirms if there is pointcloud in the detection area
2. Inserts stop point l[m] in front of the stop line
3. Inserts a pass judge point to a point where the vehicle can stop with a max deceleration
4. Sets velocity as zero behind the stop line when the ego-vehicle is in front of the pass judge point
5. If the ego vehicle has passed the pass judge point already, it doesnâ€™t stop and pass through.

| Parameter             | Type   | Description                                                                                        |
| --------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `stop_margin`         | double | [m] a margin that the vehicle tries to stop before stop_line                                       |
| `use_dead_line`       | bool   | [-] weather to use dead line or not                                                                |
| `dead_line_margin`    | double | [m] ignore threshold that vehicle behind is collide with ego vehicle or not                        |
| `use_pass_judge_line` | bool   | [-] weather to use pass judge line or not                                                          |
| `state_clear_time`    | double | [s] when the vehicle is stopping for certain time without incoming obstacle, move to STOPPED state |
