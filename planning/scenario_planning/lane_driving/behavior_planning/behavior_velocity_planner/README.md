# Behavior Velocity Planner

## Overview

`behavior_velocity_planner` is a planner that adjust velocity based on the traffic rules.
It consists of several modules.

- Blind Spot
- Crosswalk
- Detection Area
- [Intersection](intersection-design.md)
- Stop Line
- [Traffic Light](traffic-light-design.md)
- Occlusion Spot

When each module plans velocity, it considers based on `base_link`(center of rear-wheel axis) pose.
So for example, in order to stop at a stop line with the vehicles' front on the stop line, it calculates `base_link` position from the distance between `base_link` to front and modifies path velocity from the `base_link` position.

## Modules

### Stop Line

#### Role

This module plans velocity so that the vehicle can stop right before stop lines and restart driving after stopped.

#### Module Parameters

| Parameter         | Type   | Description                                                                                    |
| ----------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `stop_margin`     | double | a margin that the vehicle tries to stop before stop_line                                       |
| `stop_check_dist` | double | when the vehicle is within `stop_check_dist` from stop_line and stopped, move to STOPPED state |

#### Flowchart

```plantuml
@startuml
title modifyPathVelocity
start

:find collision between path and stop_line;

if (collision is found?) then (yes)
else (no)
  stop
endif

:find offset segment;

:calculate stop pose;

:calculate distance to stop line;

if (state is APPROACH) then (yes)
  :set stop velocity;

  if (vehicle is within stop_check_dist?) then (yes)
    if (vehicle is stopped?) then (yes)
      :change state to STOPPED;
    endif
  endif
else if (state is STOPPED) then (yes)
  if (vehicle started to move?) then (yes)
    :change state to START;
  endif
else if (state is START) then (yes)
  if ([optional] far from stop line?) then (yes)
    :change state to APPROACH;
  endif
endif

```

This algorithm is based on `segment`.
`segment` consists of two node points. It's useful for removing boundary conditions because if `segment(i)` exists we can assume `node(i)` and `node(i+1)` exist.

![node_and_segment](./docs/stop_line/node_and_segment.drawio.svg)

First, this algorithm finds a collision between reference path and stop line.
Then, we can get `collision segment` and `collision point`.

![find_collision_segment](./docs/stop_line/find_collision_segment.drawio.svg)

Next, based on `collision point`, it finds `offset segment` by iterating backward points up to a specific offset length.
The offset length is `stop_margin`(parameter) + `base_link to front`(to adjust head pose to stop line).
Then, we can get `offset segment` and `offset from segment start`.

![find_offset_segment](./docs/stop_line/find_offset_segment.drawio.svg)

After that, we can calculate a offset point from `offset segment` and `offset`. This will be `stop_pose`.

![calculate_stop_pose](./docs/stop_line/calculate_stop_pose.drawio.svg)

#### Flowchart

flow chart is almost the same as stop line.

### Detection Area

#### Role

If pointcloud is detected in a detection area defined on a map, the stop planning will be executed at the predetermined point.

![brief](./docs/detection_area/detection_area.svg)

#### Launch Timing

Launches if there is a detection area on the target lane.

### Algorithm

1. Gets a detection area and stop line from map information and confirms if there is pointcloud in the detection area
2. Inserts stop point l[m] in front of the stop line
3. Inserts a pass judge point to a point where the vehicle can stop with a max deceleration
4. Sets velocity as zero behind the stop line when the ego-vehicle is in front of the pass judge point
5. If the ego vehicle has passed the pass judge point already, it doesnâ€™t stop and pass through.

### Occlusion Spot

#### Role

This module plans safe velocity to slow down before reaching collision point that hidden object is darting out from `occlusion spot` where driver can't see clearly because of obstacles.

![brief](./docs/occlusion_spot/occlusion_spot.svg)

#### Occlusion Spot Private

This module only works in private road and use occupancy grid map to detect occlusion spots.

#### Occlusion Spot Public

This module only works in public road and use dynamic objects to detect occlusion spots.

Considering all occupancy grid cells inside focus range requires a lot of computation cost, so this module ignores to search farther occlusion spot which is longitudinally or laterally slice once occlusion spot is found.
